# What is this module
This module contains the ICP registration algorithms used in the author's master thesis.  
All implementations are written in pure Python, using numpy as main data structure. 

# What can you do with this nice piece of software
This module contains:
- I/O point cloud data with supported file formats: ".xyz", ".ply"
- (Open3D visualizer) (their routines can also be called) 
- Surface normal estimation
- Curvature estimation 
- ICP variants from \cite{TODO}
